My own idea turned out to be a simple combination of Dumb Money and The Codex's Ideas, but combined with an overall sentiment - a supervised learning or a trainable model.

# Idea
Scrape reddit's r/WallStreetBets. Use NLP to get stonk sentiment. Try to avoid sentiment engine downsides.
Reddit API or with BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium. Or build a simple social media API wrapper, for many API.

# Analyze text syntax.
Named entities, Noun phrases, Noun concepts, Verbs, Sentiments

# Post-Analyze Processing
From gathered information, label the data, and let NN learn from supervision.
