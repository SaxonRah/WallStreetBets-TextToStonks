# Rah's Belief Model
Written - JAN-25-2021 - Uses GPU computation
My own idea turned out to be a simple combination of Dumb Money and The Codex's Ideas, but combined with an overall sentiment - a supervised learning or a trainable model.

# Idea
Scrape reddit's r/WallStreetBets. Use NLP to get stonk sentiment. Try to avoid sentiment engine downsides.
Reddit API or with BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium. Or build a simple social media API wrapper, for many API.

# Analyze text syntax.
Named entities, Noun phrases, Noun concepts, Verbs, Sentiments

# Post-Analyze Processing
From gathered information, label the data, and let NN learn from supervision.

Don't. Not yet, atleast. Let something be finished first. It's just a collection of scripts and ideas. Be paitent.
Everything will be "self_test()"-able, so you can learn how everything is structured. Should be pretty self explainitory if you follow the self_test()'s
